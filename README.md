# N-Body Simulation

A simple n-body simulation of the Sun, Earth, Mars, and a comet.

## Running the simulation

To run the simulation, you need Python and the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib

Then, you can run the simulation by executing the following command:
```
python n_body_simulation.py
```

## Output

The simulation will generate two files:
- `energy_conservation.png`: A plot showing the conservation of energy in the system.
- `n_body_simulation.gif`: A GIF animation of the n-body simulation.
